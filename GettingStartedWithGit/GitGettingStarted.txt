       Fork
-	Fork
-	In the command problem, “git clone https://github.com/nitindipsite/paleo-recipes”
To keep in sync with upstream branch
-	Go the cloned directory paleo-recipes and type “git remote –v”
-	Type “git remote add upstream https://github.com/blainsmith/paleo-recipes.git”
-	Now again type “git remote –v” and you should also see the upstream repo as upstream and your forked as origin

origin  		https://github.com/nitindipsite/paleo-recipes.git (fetch)
origin  		https://github.com/nitindipsite/paleo-recipes.git (push)
upstream        	https://github.com/blainsmith/paleo-recipes.git (fetch)
upstream        	https://github.com/blainsmith/paleo-recipes.git (push)

        To Checkin
         Add a file: git add Controller\HomeController.cs
        Commit new files: git commit –m “some useful check in message”
        Commit changes: git commit –a 
        Check in:  git push –u origin master

        On Another merge syncing the changes you just merged
        One way is to stash the changes on this branch and pull the changes from the remote
        Check status showing modified changes: git status
        Stash the changes: git stash
         You can run ‘git status’ again to see your local changes are stashed away, also run ‘git stash list’
        Now pull the changes from remote: git pull (this fetches and merges)
        Now apply your local changes: git stash apply
        If you run git status now, you may see some complain about ‘both modified’ so open the file and merge the changes and do ‘git add HomeController.cs’
        Finally push these changes to the remote
